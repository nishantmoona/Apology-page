        <h3>I have been thinking a lot about our friendship and all the moments that made it special. I wanted to share how much I value you as a friend and express my apologies for causing us to drift apart.</h3>
        <p>1. Amongst all my friends, you were the first to respond to my assignments (Microsoft Form).</p>
        <p>2. Our late-night chats were something like a deep connection with you and I always looked forward to. They were filled with laughs and moments I cherish.</p>
        <p>3. Each time I saw your message, I could not help but smile knowing you took the time to connect.</p>
        <p>4. I remember how happy I felt sending you flowers to wish you well for your exam. It filled my heart with joy knowing that I could bring a smile to your face.</p>
        <p>5. You have been such a harmless creature and drama-less and easy to talk to. It is rare to find someone so genuine and I admire that about you.</p>
        <p>6. I shall never forget our fun conversations like the Paris kidnapping and the Eiffel Tower story. They still bring a smile to my face when I think about them.</p>
        <p>7. On friendship day, I realised how special our connection by sending you the picture of chocolate cupcakes and then real goods story by sending you a coffee. It was the real beginning of friendship.</p>
        <p>8. You taught me so many good things. I admire and respect who you are and the positive influence you have had on me.</p>
        <h3>I miss our conversations and your warmth. I deeply regret anything that might have caused us to stop talking.</h3>
            <p>With sincere apologies and appreciation,</p>
