        <h2>Dear Aoife</h2>
        <h3>Since you have moved on from Tesco, I wanted to share something I kept to myself, I really admired how you carried yourself, you're really kind, thoughtful and uplifting to be around.</h3>
        <p>You are radiant, I like your energy. Plus you have a rare warmth.</p>
        <p>The way you flick your open hair with your hand, I don't know why but that moment froze and it always makes me smile.</p>
        <p>If you're open to it, I would love to grab a coffee and catch up for a bowling or an arcade game. No pressure at all, take your time I completely understand. If I ever seemed cold and distant that was me trying to be professional. I am sorry if it felt off. </p>
        <p>I genuinely wanted to take you to my graduation not as a date but as a friend.</p>
        <h3>Take very good care of yourself, have lots of happiness in your life.</h3>
        <p>With sincere affection</p>
